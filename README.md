  <p>Sea-Land Segmentation based on Superpixel Fuzzy C-Means Clustering and Modified Chan-Vese Model From Optical Images. This is a project created for Computer Vision course that I took during 5th semester. I work with 3 other members to create this project. We use Superpixel Fuzzy C-Means Clustering and Modified Chan-Vese Model to segment the image into sea and land. We use Python and OpenCV to create this project. We also use Streamlit to create the web app.</p>
